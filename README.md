# rwd
This project employs its own framework and grid. Fluid design is achieved by combining advanced features of HTML5 and CSS3.

The HTML5 PICTURE tag downloads different images for mobile or desktop. There are responsive SVG charts implemented in NVD3. There is also a GulpFile that builds both the SASS and minifies JS and CSS for distribution.
